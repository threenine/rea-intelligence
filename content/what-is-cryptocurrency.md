## What is Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrencies are digital coins that arenâ€™t controlled by a central authority but through a network of equally privileged participants that follow an agreed set of rules. 

The three ingredients that make a cryptocurrency are: 
* Peer-To-Peer (p2p) network
* Cryptography
* Consensus mechanism.
