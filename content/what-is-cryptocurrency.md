Cryptocurrency is an digital virtual cash system that doesn't rely on central banks or trusted third parties to verify transactions and create new units. Instead, it uses cryptography to confirm transactions on a publicly **distributed ledger** called the **Blockchain**, enabling direct peer-to-peer payments.

The term **cryptocurrency** is applied to a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security.  Usually there is no physical form and is not typically redeemable against another commodity. 

It has no physical form and is not redeemable in another commodity like gold, they are also not controlled by any central government bank or central authority. 

The first cryptocurrency to capture the public attention was **Bitcoin**, which was launched in 2009 by an individual or group which has chosen to be known under the pseudonym **Satoshi Nakamoto**.

Cryptocurrencies are controlled through a network of equally privileged participants that follow an agreed set of rules. 

The three ingredients that make a cryptocurrency are: 

* Peer-To-Peer (p2p) network
* Cryptography
* Consensus mechanism.
