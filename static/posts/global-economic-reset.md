Since the start of a new decade for the world, it has been caught in a vice like grip of a formerly little known virus of Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2)  or otherwise known as Corona Virus.

The Virus is purported to have initially identified after an outbreak in Wuhan, China.  The general consensus among researchers studying the spread of the virus pinpoints COVID-19's most likely origin to a *wet market* or live animal market within Wuhan. The origin theory for the virus is supplemented by preliminary research into the disease’s genome, as well as the origins of similar diseases. 

Researchers at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre published the genome of COVID-19 two weeks after cases were reported in late December 2019. Gene sequencing analysis strongly suggests the virus originated in bats and was transferred to humans through a yet-unidentified intermediary species. 

In early February, Chinese researchers published work suggesting the intermediary species may have been the pangolin (a scaly anteater), though this work has not yet undergone a peer-reviewed study.

The conditions for such inter-species pathogen transfer are ripe in wet markets, which are common in parts of Asia, Africa and Latin America. 

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), resulted from a virus transferring from bats to civet cats and then to humans. SARS, discovered in 2003, originated at a wet market similar to the one now suspected to be the origin of COVID-19.

Researchers at **ETH Zurich** released a study in early March that placed the origins of COVID-19 in November at the earliest. 

Research published by the **Scripps Research Institute** in February strongly implies that the virus in humans arose naturally through inter-species transfer, putting its origin in late November or early December 2019. Both studies point to the virus’s origin in Hubei province, China.

The general consensus among experts researching the virus places the beginning of its spread at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China.

Irrespective of the origins of the Virus, one thing that stands out is that as a species, human beings destroy ecosystems and often farm animals in quite cruel, crowded conditions. These two things expose humanity to really dangerous viruses from animals.

As a species, we all need to accept some responsibility and wake up to the fact we need to treat our planet, environment, other creatures and ecosystem with more respect. There is no one person, culture, nation, race, religion or political system that we are are able to blame.  

The entire human race, irrespective of nationality, culture, creed or race need to take full brunt of the burden of blame because each and every single one of us are share the responsibility for it.  Primarily because we have all been complicit in creating the conditions for Covid-19 evolve.

## Viral Economic Impact

Probably the most devastating impact of the virus, despite killing over 20 000 and infecting over 400 000 people, in 196 countries across the globe, is the impact it had on the Global Economy.  We'll take a look at the 2 main indexes of American stock market, because as after all as the old saying goes, if America sneezes the rest of the world catches a cold.

COVID-19 has affected the global economy in three main ways: 

* Directly affecting production
* Supply chain and Market disruption
* Financial impact on firms and financial markets. 

The truth is, Covid-19 has completely revealed the true fragility of the Global Economic system, providing definitive proof that Money and Economics are completely imaginary systems, as presented in Yuval Noah Harari's book, [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](https://amzn.to/39t6ZJw).

During the initial onset of the virus, there was more concern of what affect the virus would have on the Global Economy than it would on Human lives.
