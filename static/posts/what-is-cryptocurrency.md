Since the start of a new decade for the world, it has been caught in a vice like grip of a formerly little known virus of Covid-19 or otherwise known as Corona Virus.

The Virus is purported to have initially identified after an outbreak in Wuhan, China.  The general consensus among researchers studying the spread of the virus pinpoints COVID-19's most likely origin to a *wet market* or live animal market within Wuhan. The origin theory for the virus is supplemented by preliminary research into the disease’s genome, as well as the origins of similar diseases. 

Researchers at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre published the genome of COVID-19 two weeks after cases were reported in late December 2019. Gene sequencing analysis strongly suggests the virus originated in bats and was transferred to humans through a yet-unidentified intermediary species. 

In early February, Chinese researchers published work suggesting the intermediary species may have been the pangolin (also called a scaly anteater), though this work has not yet undergone a peer-reviewed study.

The conditions for such inter-species pathogen transfer are ripe in wet markets, which are common in parts of Asia, Africa and Latin America. 

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), resulted from a virus transferring from bats to civet cats and then to humans. SARS, discovered in 2003, originated at a wet market similar to the one now suspected to be the origin of COVID-19.

Researchers at **ETH Zurich** released a study in early March that placed the origins of COVID-19 in November at the earliest. 

Research published by the **Scripps Research Institute** in February strongly implies that the virus in humans arose naturally through inter-species transfer, putting its origin in late November or early December 2019. Both studies point to the virus’s origin in Hubei province, China.

The general consensus among experts researching the virus places the beginning of its spread at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China.
